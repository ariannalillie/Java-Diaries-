# Java
Sun Microsystems released the Java programming language in 1995. Java is known for being simple, portable, secure and robust.

**Java is a compiled programming language, meaning the code we write in a .java file is transformed into byte code by a compiler before it is executed by the Java Virtual Machine on your computer.**

## Java Classes
Classes can be thought of as a single concept. Each file has one primary class named after the file.

```Java
public class HelloWorld {

}
```
